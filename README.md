# Ant Stampede Simulator

##Description
This project simulates an ant stampede scenario. The ants, represented in a string format, are marching orderly until they hear a rumor about a dropped chicken sandwich ahead. This causes a stampede, resulting in some ants getting trampled. The program analyzes the aftermath to count how many ants have died in the chaos.

## Example

### Given an orderly trail of ants:

```..ant..ant.ant...ant.ant..ant.ant....ant..ant.ant.ant...ant..```

### After the stampede, the trail may look like this:

```...ant...ant..nat.ant.t..ant...ant..ant..ant.anant..t```

The program will determine the number of ants that have died during the stampede.
